# Netflix Landing Page Clone
I created this landing page to showcase what I've learned so far in my coding journey.
This is also an alternate and extended version of my submission for SheCodes.io monthly challenge.

The theme is 'Binge-Worthy TV Shows'. 

My show of choice is The Glory. 

> __Disclaimer:__ I don't own the rights to the images, logomarks, symbols, logos, icons or the Netflix name.  
The carousel featured is from noirsociety on CodePen: https://codepen.io/noirsociety

### This looks best on a full-screen, full sized browser (*idk how to optimise yet, i'm new here*)
